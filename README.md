# Suffix Tree Based Code Base Search

In this mini-project we are going to build a code base search engine with
[suffix trees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_tree), [nodejs express
framework](http://expressjs.com/), and either backbonejs or angularjs
for your mvc framework; if you prefer to not use a frontend mvc, that's
fine too.
